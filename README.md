**Key Analyses:**

* **Order Volume & Revenue:** Determined the total orders and calculated the overall revenue generated.
* **Pizza Popularity:** Identified the most popular pizza size and the top 5 most ordered pizza types.
* **Order Patterns:** Analyzed order distribution across hours of the day and calculated the average daily order volume.
* **Category Analysis:** Explored the total quantity and distribution of pizzas across different categories.
* **Revenue Deep Dive:** 
    * Identified the highest-priced pizza.
    * Determined the top 3 revenue-generating pizza types overall.
    * Calculated the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
    * Analyzed the cumulative revenue generated over time.
    * Uncovered the top 3 revenue-generating pizza types within each category.

**MySQL Concepts Utilized:**

**Data Definition Language (DDL):** Creating tables, defining data types (e.g., INT, DECIMAL, VARCHAR), and establishing table relationships.
**Data Manipulation Language (DML):** Inserting data from Excel sheets into tables, selecting, filtering, and aggregating data using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `JOIN` clauses.
**Data Query Language (DQL):** Writing complex queries to perform calculations (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT), identify trends, and generate insights from the data.

**Data Sources:**

Excel sheets imported into MySQL tables.

**Tools Used:**

MySQL
